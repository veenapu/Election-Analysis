2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3. The county with the highest turnout

- SoftwareL Python 3.7.13, Visual Code 1.68.0

## **Election-Audit Summary:**
In addition to the total number of votes, this python script can be used to determine the number of votes cast in each county and its percentage, the winning county, the winner - winner's county, winning percentage and teh winning voter count and also the number of votes and percentage for each cadidate that ran in the election. We can also add the visualization of other features.  Here are a couple of examples:

Apart from this we can also incorporate script to do the following:
1. we can add code to determine the eligibility of the voter to see the validity of the vote, whether the person was eligible to vote or not
2. we can also add code to include the type of voting method like paper, machine, online, postal, open ballot, in person, etc., and pull different stats
